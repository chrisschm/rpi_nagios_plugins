# Raspberry Pi Nagios Plugins

## Paths to find components

The paths of many Nagios components differs by installationtype. This repository will use paths by installation from source <code>/usr/local/nagios/</code>. If you use Nagios installed by the paketmanager, you may need to change them to <code>/usr/lib/nagios/</code>.
